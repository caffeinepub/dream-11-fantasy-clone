## Summary
**Goal:** Build a fantasy sports platform where users can create fantasy teams, join paid contests, and compete on leaderboards based on player performance scoring.

**Planned changes:**
- Implement Internet Identity authentication for secure user registration and login
- Create player database with athlete information (name, team, position, form, price)
- Build team creation interface with position-based selection and budget constraints
- Implement contest system with entry fees, prize pools, and capacity limits
- Add points scoring system based on player performance metrics (goals, assists, clean sheets)
- Create leaderboard display showing contest rankings by total points
- Integrate Stripe payment system for contest entry fees
- Implement wallet system for managing balance, deposits, entry fees, and winnings
- Apply modern sporty design theme with vibrant greens and oranges, bold typography, and card-based layouts

**User-visible outcome:** Users can register via Internet Identity, build fantasy teams within budget, join paid contests, track their wallet balance, and compete on leaderboards as their teams earn points from player performances.
